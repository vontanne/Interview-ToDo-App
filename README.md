# TODO App with NestJS, Prisma, and MySQL

This project is a simple TODO application built with **NestJS**, **Prisma**, and **MySQL**. It includes basic authentication and a TODO management system.

## Task for Candidates

You are tasked with **reviewing, improving, and fixing this codebase**. This application intentionally contains poor practices, missing features, and bugs. Your goal is to refactor and enhance the project while following modern backend development best practices.

---

## Requirements

Your submission must include the following:

### 1. **Code Improvements**

- Refactor the codebase to follow clean architecture and modular design principles.
- Ensure proper error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks, meaningful HTTP response codes).
- Implement middleware for authentication and JWT validation.
- Use DTOs and validation pipes for incoming requests.
- Avoid hardcoded values (e.g., `.env` for sensitive information).
- Improve database queries to handle edge cases and optimize performance.
- Add meaningful comments where necessary.

### 2. **Unit and Integration Tests**

- Write unit tests for critical services (e.g., authentication, TODO management).
- Write at least one integration test to validate the API behavior end-to-end.

### 3. **Documentation**

- Create documentation for the APIs using Postman and put the exported collection as json in the `documentation/api` folder.
- Provide instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

### 4. **Edge Cases**

- Handle edge cases such as invalid user input, empty TODO lists, invalid authentication tokens, etc.
